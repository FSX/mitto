# Mitto

Mitto is a Thrift implementation for Tornado. Development has just started
and there is no usable code right now. Mitto wil include a Thrift client to
communicate with Thrift servers and a code generate to generator code from the
Thrift IDL.

All code that's usable goes into the `mitto` directory. Documentation goes
into `docs`. Everything else are test files.

The dependencies are Tonado and Thrift for Python.
